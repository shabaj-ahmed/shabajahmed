        <p className="mt-4">
          I&apos;m an Embedded Software Engineer at EnseraDesign with a
          background in Human Robot Interaction. My experience spans embedded
          systems, software development, mechanical design, and early-stage
          prototyping. I enjoy building technology that supports people in
          practical and meaningful ways, particularly in health, wellbeing, and
          assistive technology contexts.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          I approach engineering from a human-centred perspective. I like
          working on systems where hardware, sensing, and software come
          together, and I&apos;m comfortable collaborating across disciplines to
          take ideas from concept to working prototypes.

        <p className="mt-4">
          I currently work full-time on embedded software development at
          EnseraDesign. Alongside this, I continue to explore assistive and
          health-oriented technology through personal projects, often involving
          sensors, wearable devices, and robotics prototyping.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          My doctoral research at the University of Bristol focused on socially
          assistive robotics and long-term behaviour change. In particular, I
          designed and evaluated a Socially Assistive Robot (SAR) intervention
          intended to support sustainable habit formation in health and fitness
          contexts.
