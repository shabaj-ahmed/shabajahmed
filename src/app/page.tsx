        <p>
         I&apos;m a robotics researcher with a curiosity for how we can use machines to solve meaningful human problems, especially in the areas of health and wellbeing. My journey has taken me through automotive engineering, tech startups, and academia, but the common thread is always the same: using technology to improve people&apos;s lives.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
         I approach problems from a human-centered perspective. Whether I&apos;m developing embedded systems or designing user-focused robotic interactions, I believe in using the right tools for the job and learning new ones when needed. I bring a cross-disciplinary mindset that helps me connect ideas across domains and see patterns others might miss.

          <p>
            <strong>PhD candidate:</strong> My PhD research focuses on human-robot interaction, exploring how socially assistive robotics can support healthy habit formation. I design and evaluate robot-led interventions that encourage behaviour change, drawing from behavior science, robotics, and health technology.
