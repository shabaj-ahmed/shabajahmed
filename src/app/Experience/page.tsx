        <p className="mt-2">
          Made a webcam-based exercise game for children to play during a rainy day in school. The game was designed to be lightweight and deployable on a <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong>. The game was similar to Dino Run, which is presented when Google Chrome loses internet connection. In the game, players must jump and duck when an obstacle approaches. Pose recognition was done with <strong>MediaPipe</strong>. The Game was designed such that one script was the controller that published body poses to an <strong>MQTT broker</strong>, and the game ran on a separate script that subscribed to specific controller topics. In this way, we were able to develop different games without worrying about having to duplicate controller code. As a result, to demonstrate scalability, we also created a game that is similar to Flappy Birds, but instead of jumping and ducking, players would squat to variable depths to get the bird to fly through the gap.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 ml-4">Formula Student &#8211; Clutch-by-Wire System (Cardiff Racing)</h2>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Formula Student is an international competition where university teams design, build, and race a single-seat formula-style car from scratch each year. As part of Cardiff Racing&apos;s <strong>sensors, data acquisition, and electrics division</strong>, I contributed to the design and development of embedded systems for vehicle control.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          My most significant contribution was the creation of Cardiff Racing&apos;s <strong>first clutch-by-wire system</strong>, replacing the traditional foot pedal with steering wheel-mounted paddles. This system was developed to solve a recurring issue with the legacy design, where the steel cable in the foot-actuated clutch frequently failed under load. Additionally, the limited space in the cockpit made it difficult to accommodate three pedals comfortably, and drivers often pressed the clutch accidentally during gear changes, which compromised driver safety and performance.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          The new system used a <strong>servo motor</strong> to provide precise clutch control and a <strong>reversible bistable solenoid</strong> to actuate the sequential gearbox. I developed the control logic using <strong>LabVIEW</strong> and deployed it on a <strong>myRIO embedded controller</strong>, which interfaced with the car&apos;s ECU. When the driver requested a gear change, the myRIO sent an upshift or downshift signal to the ECU. If the engine revs were within a safe range, the ECU then triggered the solenoid to complete the shift ‚Äî ensuring both mechanical safety and smooth transitions during high-performance driving.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          My responsibilities included LabVIEW programming, ECU interfacing, designing mechanical components in <strong>SolidWorks</strong> validated through <strong>Finite Element Analysis (FEA)</strong>, building and testing custom electrical circuits, performing <strong>Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)</strong> to ensure safety, and collaborating in weekly team meetings alongside writing detailed technical documentation.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          The system operated flawlessly during testing and competition and contributed significantly to <strong>Cardiff Racing becoming the first UK team to win the international Formula Student competition.</strong> This experience deepened my understanding of embedded control systems, electromechanical design, and the importance of reliability and safety in high-performance environments.
