      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-8">Executive Summary</h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        Exercise journaling is an essential aspect of an athlete&apos;s health
        and fitness journey. Allowing them to plan, actualise, and comprehend
        their goals. A journal is a way to think through the process of becoming
        faster, stronger, or more skilled over time by providing a clear
        measurement towards completing a goal. It is difficult for an athlete to
        improve without knowing what they are currently capable of. As a result,
        journaling can add a multiplier to an athlete&apos;s fitness growth,
        leading to better and more predictable progress.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        Progressable is a mobile application for exercise journaling. It enables
        athletes to create custom workout routines and track exercise-related
        metrics such as reps, sets, weight lifted, exercise duration, or
        calories burned. It then uses historical data of the athlete&apos;s
        performance to populate targets to hit for their current workout. This
        allows athletes to compete with their previous best performance and
        continue pushing for progress. This approach ensures that workouts
        constantly evolve with the user, helping them break through plateaus and
        continuously strive for improvement. Additionally, suppose an exercise
        can&apos;t be performed due to equipment shortage or a change in desire
        to perform the exercise. In that case, athletes can substitute the
        exercise for another during the current workout, ensuring their workout
        remains uninterrupted and effective even during peak gym hours.

        Market size evaluation
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        Our primary target audience is athletes aged 18 to 35 who participate in
        powerlifting, weightlifting, and bodybuilding, a demographic known for
        its dedication to fitness and a propensity to invest in tools that
        enhance training outcomes. The reason for starting with weight training
        is because workout performance is objective, i.e., weight lifted, reps,
        sets and rest time are quantifiable. The age bracket was chosen as this
        is the competitive age range of athletes.

        We calculated our TAM based on the number of people that have gym
        memberships across Europe and the United States , which was
        approximately 115 million people. According to consensus data , 14% of
        these people go to the gym almost every day, which makes our SAM 16.1
        million people. From this, we intend to capture 5% of the market share
        by the end of 5 years, which will equate to 805,000.

        The current method of tracking workouts predominantly consists of using
        a notepad and pen. However, this method of tracking is not consistent;
        it is difficult to keep track of exercises from one workout to the next,
        and unless duplicated to a spreadsheet, it does not give granular
        details of temporal changes in performance. Progressable has been set up
        to provide athletes with the tools they need to reduce their cognitive
        load and focus on reaching peak physical performance as efficiently as

        For anyone who is training to improve their physical fitness, knowing
        what their body is capable of and how hard they need to push themselves
        is a vital metric in accelerating progress. This ensures that they do
        not overwork their body, which can lead to injury or underwork their
        body, leading to slower performance gains. Our app generates targets for
        athletes to achieve based on their previous performance during their
        last workout. It eliminates the guesswork in workout planning and
        progression tracking, ensuring that every session in the gym is
        purposeful and builds upon the last. This targeted approach accelerates
        progress and significantly reduces the risk of injury due to
        overtraining. Moreover, if an exercise is not possible due to a lack of
        equipment or a change in preference, athletes can easily substitute it
        for another one during the current workout.

        performance and allow them to take pre-emptive action to preserve their
        health and longevity. With the additional data, the athlete can make
        sport-specific training adjustments to get targeted performance
        improvements. For example, suppose an athlete is seeing a slow and
        continual decrease in performance. In that case, it may indicate that
        they are overworking their body and, therefore, not recovering fast
        enough. As a result, they may choose to take time off or reduce workout
        volume to allow their body to heal.

        Over the next year, our primary focus will be to deeply understand our
        users&rsquo; needs and refine our app&apos;s functionality to serve them
        better. We aim to conduct comprehensive market research and gather
        feedback from at least 100 current users, supplemented by in-depth
        interviews with 50 users and personal trainers. This approach will
        ensure we&apos;re not just guessing but are precisely tailoring our app
        based on direct user insights.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        This feedback will guide the integration of biometric data collection

        Our target is to successfully launch these features and see a 20%
        increase in user engagement with the new functionalities. Achieving this
        will solidify our transition towards a more coaching-centric model,

        connect with personal trainers, making it as simple as a few taps on
        their screen. We aim to onboard at least 100 personal trainers and match
        them with users, targeting a 25% increase in user subscriptions
        attributed to this new feature. The personal trainers/coaches will be
        recruited through targeted outreach within the fitness industry,
        ensuring we bring on board professionals who are as dedicated to our

        We will also develop and integrate advanced digital twin technology,

        Progressable aims to expand its product range in the future by
        diversifying its offerings. Initially, we will offer self-tracking and
        self-coaching services, and then we plan to move forward with hiring
        external coaches to train clients online. We will use a revenue-sharing

      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        In the future, we hope to expand our product offering by incorporating
        other hardware into our app. This hardware will include biometric
        sensors like heart rate, breathing rate and body temperature, as well as
        sensors that measure workout intensity, such as bar speed sensors and
        power meters.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        There is a possibility of spinning off a hardware division to provide
        athletes and coaches with the tools they need to assess training
        performance and ensure that the athletes are progressing towards their
        goals safely and efficiently. This may include developing velocity,
        impact, or wearable sensors, depending on the adoption of the hardware

        Our target is to acquire 805,000 customers by the end of year 5 (refer
        to the Market size evaluation section), with a monthly compounding
        growth rate of 23%. This growth rate presents itself as an exponential
        curve, with the majority of growth taking place in years 4 and 5. We
        have confidence in the unique value proposition of Progressable and the
        increasing demand for specialised fitness tools. We believe that we can
        capture the 805,000 customers we are targeting. A detailed breakdown of
        the financial forecast is provided in Table 2 with a break even analysis
        provided in Figure 2.

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-8">Financial Strategy</h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        The financial plan has been devised to identify the minimum amount of
        funding required. This means that until Progressable becomes profitable,
        operational costs are minimised, and no salaries are paid. Initial funds
        will concentrate on critical areas of product development for the first
        two years.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        In the third year, we plan to initiate paid marketing strategies,
        including social media advertising, to enhance user acquisition and
        retention. Additionally, we will start compensating our executive team
        with minimum wage and move operations into a coworking space to foster a
        collaborative working environment.

        Platform fee and retention (churn)

      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        The platform fees are 30% across both Google and Apple for the first
        year a user subscribes to our app, reducing to 15% thereafter. Our
        financial models assume each user will engage with our service for one
        year, contributing to our LTV calculations Â£99.99x70%=Â£69.99. This model
        will be adjusted based on actual user retention patterns and

        Expenses and projections

        To ensure financial sustainability, expenses for each year were adjusted

        Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), as outlined in Table 3. Please refer to
        Table 2 for a detailed breakdown of expenses. Sustainable growth is

          <strong>Aggressive Growth Targets:</strong>: Our financial forecast is
          dependent on achieving a 23% monthly compounding growth rate, leading
          to 805,000 customers by the end of year 5. This growth is ambitious
          and may be difficult to sustain, especially without significant brand
          recognition. To mitigate this risk, we will implement a phased growth
          strategy. The initial focus will be on building a strong user base by
          leveraging niche marketing and community-building strategies. We plan
          to adjust our marketing spend based on early performance indicators
          and user feedback, allowing us to refine our approach continuously.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dependency on subscription model:</strong>Our revenue model is
          dependent on subscriptions, and the high platform fees (30%) could
          erode profit margins. We will be experimenting with diversifying our
          revenue streams to decrease our dependence on a single income source.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Market penetration and competition:</strong> The fitness app
          market is competitive, with many established players. Penetrating this
          market as a late entrant could be challenging. Progressable aims to
          differentiate itself by focusing on experienced athletes and providing
          more advanced, customisable features than competitors. We can look at
          partnerships with Gyms and other fitness professionals to increase our
          market penetration and credibility.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Financial sustainability:</strong> Assuming all new customers
          will maintain their subscriptions for a full year might not align with
          actual customer behaviour, impacting our financial projections.
          Regularly reviewing customer usage and retention data will allow us to
          adjust our business model in real-time. Implementing a robust
          analytics framework will enable us to understand user behaviour better
          and adapt our strategies accordingly.
