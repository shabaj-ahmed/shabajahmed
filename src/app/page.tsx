        <p className="mt-4">
          I&apos;m a robotics engineer and researcher passionate about developing technology to solve meaningful human problems, particularly in health and wellbeing. My professional journey spans automotive engineering, tech startups, and academic research, but the common thread has always been using intelligent sensing and embedded systems to positively impact people&apos;s lives.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          I approach challenges from a human-centred perspective, integrating robotics, machine learning, and embedded technologies to build user-focused systems. My multidisciplinary experience enables me to quickly learn and apply the right tools, connect ideas across diverse domains, and discover innovative solutions.

        <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Current Work and Interests</h1>
          <p className="mt-4">
            I recently completed my PhD at the University of Bristol, specialising in human-robot interaction and socially assistive robotics. My research focused on designing robot-led interventions that support habit formation and encourage sustainable behaviour change, drawing insights from behavioural science, robotics, and health technologies.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            I'm currently looking for opportunities in robotics, research engineering, or scientific software engineering roles, where I can leverage my skills in multimodal sensor integration, real-time inference, and intelligent embedded systems to develop impactful solutions.
